# Pothole Detection with YOLOv7 üïµÔ∏è

![Alt text for your GIF](imgs/output.gif)

This project leverages the powerful YOLOv7 object detection model, implemented in PyTorch, to accurately identify potholes in road images. The goal is to enhance road safety and maintenance efficiency through advanced computer vision techniques.

## Introduction

Potholes pose significant risks to road safety, contributing to accidents and vehicle damage. This project addresses this issue by employing YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect and localize potholes in various road conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.8.1+
- CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`



### Dataset

The training dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle at [Pothole Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sovitrath/pothole-detection-yolov4-format). After downloading, extract the dataset into a directory within the project folder.

### Training the Model

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Pothole_Detection_YOLOv7.ipynb`) that guides you through the model training process. You can run this notebook on Google Colab or locally, provided you have the appropriate hardware setup.

## Usage

After training, the model can be used to detect potholes in new images or video streams. The notebook provides detailed instructions on how to run inference with the trained model.

## Results

Watch the model in action and see the detection results in this video demonstration on my YouTube channel: [YOLOv7 Pothole Detection Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DObED2beMIg).
